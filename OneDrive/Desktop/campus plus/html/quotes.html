                        many qualitative opportunities during hours of studying and preparing for university exams. It
                        recently had an update, and now even personal organization of the dashboard is possible through
                        the
                        selection of preferred tools and their order. Everything I need for lectures is there."</p>

                    <p>"Testimonial 6: I have 15 years of success using Moodle. Moodle is equipped with all the tools I
                        need
                        to provide online instruction in my Microsoft 365 online courses. With Moodle, I was able to
                        develop
                        and implement an online training methodology that has proven successful from the beginning,
                        thanks
                        to Moodle's infrastructure. I always check the students' results, update course content, and
                        update
                        didactics. The overall results are exceptional: student retention is +100%, and student
                        satisfaction
                        is +98% and improving."</p>

                    <p>"Testimonial 7: I like Moodle's architecture for the learning management system. It offers
                        multiple
                        options to upload videos, and audio, and provide assignments to students. It also has quiz
                        options
                        and many more features. I don't need much time to develop and deploy the learning management
                        system.
                        I can install Moodle in 5-10 minutes on my server. The installation process is also easy for
                        non-tech persons."</p>
